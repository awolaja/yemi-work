This Python Lambda script appears to be a serverless function that handles data orchestration tasks. Let's break down its functionality:

get_dataset_sfn_input: This function is responsible for generating the input data for a specific dataset in a data orchestration workflow. It takes parameters such as dataset_list (a list of datasets), dataset (the current dataset), config_bucket (the S3 bucket where the configuration file is stored), config_file_prefix (the prefix for the configuration file), and input_execution_dict (a dictionary containing input execution details). The function starts by retrieving the logger object and initializing an empty config_object dictionary. It then iterates through the dataset_list to find the configuration details for the given dataset. Once the configuration is found, it reads the configuration file using the read_config_file function and assigns the result to config_object. Based on the orchestration_type in the config_object, it constructs an sfn_input dictionary with different key-value pairs for FACT and DIM types. Finally, it returns the orchestration_type and sfn_input.
filter_datasets: This function filters the datasets based on certain criteria and generates separate lists for FACT and DIM types. It takes parameters dataset_list (a list of datasets), input_execution_file (a dictionary specifying the location of the input execution file), config_bucket (the S3 bucket where the configuration file is stored), and config_file_prefix (the prefix for the configuration file). The function retrieves the logger object and logs the details of the input execution file being read. It then loads the input_execution_file using the yaml.safe_load function. Two empty lists, fact_sfn_input_list and dim_sfn_input_list, are initialized. Next, it iterates through each dataset in the input_execution_dict and calls the get_dataset_sfn_input function to retrieve the orchestration type and sfn_input. Depending on the orchestration type, the sfn_input is appended to the corresponding list. Finally, it returns the lists of FACT and DIM inputs.
lambda_handler: This is the entry point function for the Lambda handler. It takes event (the input event data) and context (the runtime information). The function sets the logger object and logs the Lambda handler and test event details. It retrieves the dataset_list by reading the configuration file from the specified config_bucket and config_file. The config_file_prefix is extracted from the config_file. The filter_datasets function is called to filter the datasets based on the input file path and retrieve separate lists for FACT and DIM inputs. Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the lists of FACT and DIM inputs.
In summary, this Lambda script is designed to handle data orchestration by generating input data for different datasets based on their configurations. The get_dataset_sfn_input function constructs the input data for each dataset, and the filter_datasets function filters and organizes the datasets based on their orchestration types. The lambda_handler function serves as the main entry point for the Lambda function, coordinating the retrieval of dataset configurations and generating the final output.
